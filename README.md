##### a funny story

When i was in the 4th grade we were supposed to do homework in group once. It was about writing some poem. My friend and I made it in the garden of the school 5 minutes before class, of course. Once it was finally finished we rushed over the campus to be on time, homework in my hand, but i lost it in the wind and the homework flew away. The teacher never believed us.
